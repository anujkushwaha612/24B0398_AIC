## Final Comments

Through this assignment, I learned and implemented several new concepts from scratch, including Word2Vec with negative sampling, Transformer architecture, and semantic search with FAISS. I experimented with different hyperparameters, embedding types, and model configurations to fine-tune performance. This assignment was an excellent experience that challenged me to think deeply, explore advanced techniques, and apply them practically. It truly enhanced my understanding of modern NLP systems.
